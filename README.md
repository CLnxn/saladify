# Saladify

## Motivation

Social aggregator sites like linktr.ee tend to focus their features particularly for corporations and influencers using the site. Thus, a website that prioritises the average person’s user experience and connections could work better in this regard, where users can follow their friends and see their updated links and online (& possibly future) whereabouts. While having minimalist UI & features could make the experience a lot more streamlined and cleaner, we felt that this could limit the degree of expression and informativeness of each link on the social aggregator site. \
Additionally, losing track of friends with time due to them moving away from popular social media sites which were the only modes of communication reflects how inconvenient it is to constantly keep track of others today whom may only be present on social media platforms that are different from what you use.

## Project Description

Saladify is a website that allows users to aggregate their social media sites or any links they want to have. Whether it be for keeping in touch with a friend’s social media or to broadcast one's commissions or sites as a freelancer through following others. They can also display aggregated links on their profiles, share it with their friends or search for others on the site.
