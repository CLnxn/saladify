# Saladify

## Motivation

We notice that social aggregator sites like linktr.ee tend to focus their features particularly for corporations and influencers using the site. We felt that a website that prioritises the average joe’s user experience could work, and we felt that a networking element where users can follow their friends and see their updated links for into the future could also improve the site. While the intentionally minimalistic user interface and features could make the experience a lot more streamlined and cleaner, we felt that this could limit the degree of expression and informativeness of each link on the social aggregator site. \
Additionally, we have experienced that we have lost track of our friends with time due to them not using a social media site anymore and that was the only way we could communicate with them since we do not know their other social media accounts.

## Project Description

Saladify is a website that allows users to aggregate their social media sites or any links they want to have. Whether it be for keeping in touch with your friend’s social media or to broadcast your commissions or sites as a freelancer by following others. They can also display their aggregated links on their profile and share it to their friends and search for their friends on the social media site.
